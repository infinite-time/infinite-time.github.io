### What is a vector space?

In a vector space, for any vectors u, v, w and scalars a, b, we have-

$`[x]_y a_{b}`$

- $u + v$ is also a vector 
- $au$ is alao a vector
- $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$
- $u + v = v + u$
- $0$ vector exists
- $-u$ exists
- $s(bu) = (ab)u$
- $1u = u$
- $a(u + v) = au + av$
- $(a + b)u = au + bu$

Vector $\vec{\psi}^{\}$ is represented as $\ket{\psi}$ in quantum space.

### Linear superposition
A quantum state can be represented as a linear superposition of all possible outcome states.

$\ket{\psi} = c_1\ket{E1} + c_2\ket{E2} + c_3\ket{E3}$

$\ket{\psi}$ is a quantum state. $E1, E2, E3$ are possible states. $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are probabilities of states $E1, E2, E3$ respectively.

### Discrete and continuous possibilities
What if there are infinitely many quantum states?

$\ket{\psi} = c_1\ket{E1} + c_2\ket{E2} + c_3\ket{E3} + c_4\ket{E4}+ c_5\ket{E5} + ...$ (superposition of infinitely many outcome states).

Some states have discrete possibilities (ex: energy) $\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i}c_i\ket{x_i}$.

Some have continuous possibilities (ex: position of electron) $\ket{\psi} = \int dx c(x)\ket{x}$.

We have represented co-effecient as $c(x)$ because it is a function of $x$.
